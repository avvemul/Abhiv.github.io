title: Body Mass of Penguins

In this post, we study an example of basic data visualization in Python. We will make use of the Palmer Penguins dataset to do so.

## Setup
To begin, we read the desired dataset into the pandas library, using the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

We can get an idea of the kind of visualization we might want by previewing the data:

Taking from the preview above, we can analyze the distribution of body mass across all the penguins in the dataset. The plot.hist() function will help us with this. We can also add labels and title using the following functions:

```python
massplot = penguins['Body Mass (g)'].plot.hist()
massplot.set_xlabel('Body Mass (g)')
massplot.set_title('Distribution of Body Mass Across Palmer Penguins')
```
